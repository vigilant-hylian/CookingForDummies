# CookingForDummies
## What is?
I'm one of those people who are incredibly organised and useful in certain very specific ways, but totally useless in others. I regularly forget what my plans are for the week shortly after I make them but I bet you I can find that file I put somewhere strange a year ago.

Enter **Cooking For Dummies**. This is intended to be a project to make my cooking and meal organisation life easier. There are a few basic goals I intend to achieve:

* Creation and storage of recipes
* Simple to follow format that does not involve stupidly long and hard-to-follow paragraphs. Recipes will be broken up into components that are easy to follow. For example, a basic Spaghetti Bolognese is a one-module recipe, with all preparation done before cooking is commenced, then the steps can be simply followed to perfectly achieve optimum spaghettitude. More complex meals like a Thai Green Curry will be broken up into two modules - the paste and the curry itself. Nothing makes me more frustrated than getting 3/4 through cooking something to then discover that the next step will take 30 minutes extra preparation that could have been done at the start, offsetting the current step. Optimal cooking!
* Search by ingredients! If you have some asparagus and coriander left over and don't know what to cook - plug it into the search and find a meal that will use these leftover ingredients, with the intention of purchasing any extra ingredients. No more waste!
* Weekly meal planning - put together and follow a weekly meal plan, and actually stick to it!

## But why not use another app/service?
I've had a look around and not found anything that's just right for my needs. Meal planners are separate from recipes, recipe repositories do not allow searching by ingredients, and cannot be ported to planners. The recipe format sucks as well.

This is intended to be something new with a recipe format that will *guarantee* chef-quality results every time, without burning, screwing up, or hardcode failing. You can be your own chef with absolute ease by following this!

## Tech Stack
I've been trying to find an application for Laravel for a while and making a neat little DB-driven cooking API sounds like just the thing, so that depending on how the project goes it can be scalable and extensible.

React is a common tool nowadays and I want to really flesh out my abilities so I'm using that too.

More than anything this is something fun for me to do in my spare time and to practice!
